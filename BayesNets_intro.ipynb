An electrical system failure can result in trajectory deviation, which can be observed from the earth by telescope, as well as a communication loss that interrupts the transmission of telemetry and mission data down to various ground stations. Other anomalies not involving the electrical system can result in trajectory deviation and communication loss. (p. 34)\n",
